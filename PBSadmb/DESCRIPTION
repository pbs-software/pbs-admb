Description: A collection of software provides R support for 'ADMB'
             (Automatic Differentiation Model Builder) and a 'GUI'
             interface facilitates the conversion of 'ADMB' template
             code to 'C code' followed by compilation to a binary executable.
             Stand-alone functions can also be run by users
             not interested in clicking a 'GUI'.
